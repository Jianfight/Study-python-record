StackHPC Ltd is seeking a Python software engineer, joining our growing engineering team to help implement our vision of high performance OpenStack for scientific computing customers. Our clients tackle some of the great scientific challenges of the modern age and StackHPC is proud to support them.

This role initially involves focusing on the monitoring, logging and telemetry requirements - both the best practice of well-run OpenStack infrastructure and more specifically on pushing the boundaries of how we understand and visualise the performance of scientific applications. This involves using cutting-edge technology to unlock the secrets of cloud performance.

Working alongside our accomplished OpenStack Developers and HPC Systems Developers, this is an excellent technical environment in which to improve your craft. We offer mentoring and a rich variety of projects where you can do important work, with recognition for your contributions.

You will need to be interested in understanding and developing the inner workings of cloud infrastructure, and how to develop it to accommodate the needs of the next generation of research computing.
